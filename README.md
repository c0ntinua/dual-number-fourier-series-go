# dual-number-fourier-series-go

This program uses dual numbers for forward-mode auto-differentiation to express a target function as a sum of sine waves. The target function is itself a sum of sine waves in the same parameterized family. If you want to try it, you can read off instructions from input.go. All the controls are just keypresses (and you can mess with settings in the source code for more significant changes.)
